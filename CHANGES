trunk (unreleased)
* blkback: add 'force_close' to more forcibly tear down the device
* blkback: make 'destroy' idempotent
* blkback: measure ring utilisation; segments per request; total
  requests and responses (ok and error)
* blkback: support indirect descriptors (i.e. large block sizes)
* blkfront: if the 'connect' string is at all ambiguous, fail rather
  than risk using the wrong disk
* blkfront: use indirect segments if available

1.1.0 (30-Jan-2014):
* blkback: functorise over Activations.
* Depend on `xen-grant` and `xen-event` libraries rather than `xenctrl`.
* Remove `OS` module, depend on `io-page` (no `-unix` or `-xen`).
* Only use the high-level Activations.after interface.
* blkfront: allow 'connect' to take '51712' (bus slot) or 'xvda' or '/dev/xvda'
* blkback: improve performance through request merging
* blkback: functorise over Activations, xenstore and backing store
* blkback: add the toolstack-level device create/destroy functions

1.0.0 (10-Dec-2013):
* Add ISC copyrights everywhere.
* Indent code with `ocp-indent`.

0.5.0 (8-Dec-2013)

  mapping all requests on the ring simultaneously

0.1.3 (14-Jul-2013):

* fixed critical bug in previous version which caused pages
  to be mapped with the wrong protection flags, leading to
  immediate segfaults on write

0.1.2 (4-Jul-2013):
